        <h2>What Is Rotaract?</h2>
        <h4>
            <p> Rotary is a global network of 1.2 million neighbors, friends, leaders, and problem-solvers who see a
                world where
                people unite and take action to create lasting change – across the globe, in our communities, and in
                ourselves.
                Solving real problems takes real commitment and vision. For more than 110 years, Rotary's people of
                action have
                used their passion, energy, and intelligence to take action on sustainable projects. From literacy
                and peace to
                water and health, we are always working to better our world, and we stay committed to the end.</p>
            <p>Rotaract is an international organization of service clubs for men and women aged 18-30 that fosters
                leadership and responsible citizenship, encourages high ethical standards in business and promotes
                international understanding and peace.
                Rotaract is a program of Rotary International. Rotaract Clubs work under the guidance of their local
                Rotary Club, and take their name from a combination of the words Rotary and action. The first officially
                chartered Rotaract Club was in North Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1968, but clubs of young people
                associated in service with local Rotary Clubs had existed for several years in India and Europe.
                Today, there are some 165,000 members in more than 7,000 Rotaract Clubs in 151 countries. Clubs draw
                members from the community or are organized as an extracurricular activity for college students.
                Rotaract Clubs conduct formal meetings, usually every two weeks, which feature speakers, tours of local
                businesses, cultural activities, discussions, and visits to other clubs. Rotaractors utilize weekends
                for service project work, social events, and professional and leadership development workshops.
                Every Rotaract Club is part of a district Rotaract organization, run by elected representatives with
                support from sponsoring Rotarians. The district organization plans regional conferences, develops
                regional projects, holds club leadership training programs, and sponsors special events to strengthen
                the bond among clubs.
                Rotaract functions internationally through a committee of Rotaractors and Rotarians. This committee
                works with Rotary International to plan an annual two days-long forum held prior to the Rotary
                international convention. This event offers Rotaractors from all over the world the chance to meet,
                discuss issues of mutual interest, and develop friendships based on international goodwill and
                understanding. Every three years Rotaractors conduct another international meeting called Interota,
                named from the words international and Rotaract.</p>
