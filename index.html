        <h1> Introduction</h1>
        <h3> &emsp; Join the global movement of young leaders who
            developing innovative solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges.
            Rotaract clubs bring together people ages 18 and older to exchange ideas with leaders in the community,
            develop
            leadership and professional skills, and have fun through service. <br><br>

            &emsp;Rotaract originally began as a Rotary International youth program in 1968 at Charlotte North Rotary
            Club in
            Charlotte, North Carolina, United States, and has grown into a major organization of over 10,904 clubs
            spread around
            the world and over 203,000 members in 189 countries. It is a service, leadership, professional and community
            service
            organization (often miscommunicated as a Social Service Club) for young men and women between the ages 18
            and over.
            Rotaract focuses on the development of young adults as leaders in their communities and workplaces. Clubs
            around the
            world also take part in international service projects, in a global effort to bring peace and international
            understanding to the world. <br><br>

            &emsp;"Rotaract" stands for "Rotary in Action", although the name originally comes from a combination of
            "Rotary" and
            "Interact" (International + Action), the high school level program created by Rotary International in 1962.
            Most
            Rotaract activities take place at the club level. Rotaract clubs hold formal meetings in person or
            virtually,
            usually every two weeks, which feature speakers, special outings, social activities, discussions or visits
            to other
            clubs. Club members get together on designated days for service project work, social events, or
            professional/leadership development workshops. <br><br>

            &emsp;To be eligible for membership, prospective members must be 18 years of age and over, show that they
            are committed to
            Rotaract, and show that they are of good standing in the community. After being approved by the club,
            prospective
            members are 'inducted' to become members, also known as 'Rotaractors'. The avenues of service include Club
            Service,
            Community Service, International Service and Professional Development. Rotaract Club undertake various
            projects for
            the overall development of their members. <br><br>

            &emsp; In 2019, Rotaract went from being a program of Rotary International to being a membership type of
            Rotary
            International, elevating its status to resemble that of Rotary clubs. As of 1 July 2020, Rotaract clubs can
            exist on
            their own, or may be sponsored by Rotary and/or Rotaract clubs. This makes them true "partners in service"
            and key
            members of the family of Rotary. A Rotaract club may, but is not required to, establish upper age limits,
            provided that the club (in accordance with its bylaws) obtain the concurrence of its members and the sponsor
            club(s)
            (if sponsored). In Hong Kong， there are 8 U-based universities joint to organize an annual camp for the
            committee
            members to participate. The camp is called Interflow. <br> <br> <br> <br>
